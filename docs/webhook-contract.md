# Webhook Contract

This document defines the human-readable webhook model for schema version
`1.0.0`. `openapi.yaml` is the machine-readable authority and must remain
synchronized with this document.

## Transport

The plugin sends each event directly to the configured URL:

```http
POST /
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
event_type: <type>
event-id: <eventId>
event-sequence: <sequence>
[Authorization: Bearer <token>]
```

`event_type` is required and exactly matches the payload's `type` property.
`event-id` and `event-sequence` are required and exactly match the payload's
`eventId` and `sequence` properties. All three event headers remain unchanged
across retries.
`Authorization` is included only when a nonempty authentication token is
configured. An empty token sends an unauthenticated request.

There is no outer payload wrapper. The `type` property discriminates the event
shape. Object schemas permit undeclared properties for forward compatibility.
Unavailable optional values are omitted, never represented by `null`, empty
strings, sentinels, or fabricated values.

### Responses

Any `2xx` response is successful; the plugin ignores its body. The documented
success responses are `200 OK` and `204 No Content`.

Errors use this forward-compatible shape:

| Field     | Type   | Description                       | Rules                          |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `code`    | string | Identifier for the response error | Required machine-readable code |
| `message` | string | Explanation of the response error | Optional human-readable detail |

`503 Service Unavailable` with `code: "NO_ACTIVE_SESSION"` means the event was
valid but arrived outside an active receiver session. It is retryable and may
include `Retry-After` as integer seconds or an HTTP date.

The plugin retries network errors, `408`, `429`, and all `5xx` responses. Other
`4xx` and all `3xx` responses are permanent failures.

## Models

Models group fields by functional dependency. Events compose these nested
models instead of repeating their fields at the event root.

### Source

| Field           | Type   | Description                         | Rules                          |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `pluginName`    | string | Name of the producing plugin        | Required; `Chugmania Webhooks` |
| `pluginVersion` | string | Version of the producing plugin     | Required plugin SemVer         |
| `game`          | enum   | Trackmania game producing the event | `turbo` or `next`              |

### Game

| Field          | Type             | Description                    | Rules                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `gameId`       | UUID string      | Identity of the captured round | Required UUID v4, shared by all events in the round  |
| `totalPlayers` | positive integer | Number of players in the round | Required and constant; equals `start.players.length` |

### Player

| Field         | Type                 | Description                          | Rules                                         |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `playerIndex` | non-negative integer | Position of the player in the roster | Required, zero-based, stable within the game  |
| `name`        | string               | Display name of the player           | Optional                                      |
| `login`       | string               | Game login of the player             | Optional; emitted when exposed by the runtime |
| `localId`     | string               | Decimal engine-local login ID        | Optional; available in Next                   |
| `accountId`   | string               | Ubisoft/Nadeo WebServices account ID | Optional; available in Next                   |

`start.players` is ordered by contiguous index, so
`players[i].playerIndex == i`. Its length equals `game.totalPlayers`.
Trackmania Next sources `login`, `localId`, and `accountId` from MLFeed V4's
login, login MwId, and WebServices user ID. Turbo emits `login`, but omits the
other identifiers because its runtime does not expose equivalent values.

### Map

| Field               | Type                 | Description                                | Rules                                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `name`              | string               | Display name of the map                    | Required                                        |
| `uid`               | string               | Unique identifier of the map               | Optional                                        |
| `author`            | string               | Creator of the map                         | Optional                                        |
| `environment`       | string               | Environment or setting used by the map     | Optional                                        |
| `type`              | string               | Map type reported by the game              | Optional                                        |
| `medalTimesMs`      | MedalTimes           | Target medal times in milliseconds         | Optional                                        |
| `isLaps`            | boolean              | Whether the map uses multiple laps         | Required                                        |
| `totalLaps`         | positive integer     | Number of laps required to finish          | Optional; omitted when unknown or not lap-based |
| `checkpointsPerLap` | non-negative integer | Number of intermediate checkpoints per lap | Optional; excludes start and finish             |

### MedalTimes

| Field    | Type                 | Description             | Rules    |
| -------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| `author` | non-negative integer | Author medal time in ms | Optional |
| `gold`   | non-negative integer | Gold medal time in ms   | Optional |
| `silver` | non-negative integer | Silver medal time in ms | Optional |
| `bronze` | non-negative integer | Bronze medal time in ms | Optional |

### Mode

| Field      | Type   | Description                         | Rules                                            |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`     | enum   | Normalized local game mode          | Required; see mode values below                  |
| `type`     | string | Specific mode or rule family        | Turbo secret variant, or Next rule family        |
| `settings` | object | Available configuration of the mode | Optional primitive settings using camelCase keys |

Turbo emits `campaign`, `arcade`, `hot-seat`, `split-screen`, `secret`, or
`unknown` as `mode.name`. Next emits `solo` or `split-screen`. `unknown` is the
Turbo fallback when the game does not expose enough information to identify the
local mode positively; the plugin never guesses another mode as a fallback.

Turbo secret modes identify the activated rule set in `mode.type`:

| Secret family | `mode.type` values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Split screen  | `split-screen-classic-fun`, `split-screen-classic-pro`, `split-screen-smash-fun`, `split-screen-smash-pro`, `split-screen-mono-screen-fun`, `split-screen-mono-screen-pro`, `split-screen-stunt-fun`, `split-screen-stunt-pro`, `split-screen-bonus-fun`, `split-screen-bonus-pro` |
| Arcade        | `arcade-smash`, `arcade-stunt`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Hot seat      | `hot-seat-smash`, `hot-seat-stunt`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Next split-screen play emits one of the six selectable local rule families as
`mode.type`. `unknown` is used if the game exposes neither a recognized rule
enum nor a recognizable script name. Settings are scoped to that rule family:

| `mode.type`         | `mode.settings` fields                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `time-attack`       | `timeLimitMs`, `synchronizedStartPeriodMs`                       |
| `rounds`            | `pointsLimit`, `forcedLaps`, `useNewRules`                       |
| `laps`              | `lapCount`, `timeLimitMs`                                        |
| `cup`               | `pointsLimit`, `roundsPerMap`, `winnerCount`, `warmupDurationMs` |
| `royal-time-attack` | `timeLimitMs`                                                    |
| `platform`          | `timeLimitMs`                                                    |

Next solo play uses the same standard rule-family values and may additionally
emit `team`, `stunts`, or `script` when exposed by the active game script.

### Checkpoint

Checkpoint fields describe a player's checkpoint position. Events include them
through a nested `checkpoint` object.

| Field                   | Type                 | Description                                | Rules                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `checkpointIndex`       | non-negative integer | Global checkpoint position across laps     | `0` at the start line; otherwise positive          |
| `checkpointLapIndex`    | non-negative integer | Checkpoint position within the current lap | See line-crossing convention below                 |
| `lapNumber`             | positive integer     | Current lap                                | Required and one-based                             |
| `theoreticalDurationMs` | non-negative integer | Checkpoint time without respawn losses     | Optional; Next-only MLFeed `LastTheoreticalCpTime` |
| `lostMs`                | non-negative integer | Dependency-provided time lost on respawn   | Optional, Next-only dependency value, unchanged    |

For a map with `N = map.checkpointsPerLap`, intermediate checkpoints use
`checkpointLapIndex` values `1..N`. A `lap` event describes the shared
start/finish line as the start of the newly entered lap and therefore uses `0`.
A `finish` event describes that same line as the end of the final lap and uses
`N + 1`. The same finish convention applies to point-to-point maps, so a
start-checkpoint-finish map with one intermediate checkpoint finishes at index
`2`.

## Events

### Common Fields

Every event contains:

| Field           | Type                 | Description                             | Rules                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schemaVersion` | string               | Version of the webhook payload schema   | Required SemVer; initially `1.0.0`                       |
| `type`          | string               | Kind of event represented               | Required event discriminator                             |
| `eventId`       | UUID string          | Unique identity of the captured event   | Globally unique UUID v4; immutable across retries        |
| `sequence`      | non-negative integer | Event position within the round         | Contiguous capture order within `game.gameId`            |
| `occurredAt`    | RFC 3339 string      | Wall-clock time of capture              | UTC with millisecond precision; immutable across retries |
| `durationMs`    | non-negative integer | Race-clock time of capture              | In-game race timer when the event occurred               |
| `game`          | Game                 | Identity and player count for the round | Required                                                 |
| `source`        | Source               | Metadata describing the event producer  | Required producer metadata                               |

`start.sequence` is `0` for complete captures. When capture begins mid-round,
the first captured event also uses sequence `0`, even though no start event was
emitted.

The examples form one Trackmania Turbo round and use fields supported by both
games. For Trackmania Next, `source.game` is `next`.

### `start`

Emitted exactly once when a fully captured round begins.

| Additional field | Type     | Description                        | Rules                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `players`        | Player[] | Players participating in the round | Required; ordered and length equals `game.totalPlayers` |
| `map`            | Map      | Map played during the round        | Required                                                |
| `mode`           | Mode     | Game mode used during the round    | Required                                                |

### `first_throttle`

Emitted when the player first applies throttle during the game. It is emitted
at most once per player per game and never re-armed.

| Additional field | Type   | Description                         | Rules                                                 |

  },
  "player": {
    "playerIndex": 0,
    "name": "Player One"
  }
}
```

### `checkpoint`, `lap`, `respawn`, and `finish`

These event types share one contract:

| Event type   | Emitted when                                             | Rules                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checkpoint` | A player validates an intermediate checkpoint            | Both indices are positive; start and finish are not numbered   |
| `lap`        | A player starts a new lap after crossing the finish line | `checkpointLapIndex` is `0`; not emitted on the final finish   |
| `respawn`    | A respawn action is detected for a player                | Indices identify the destination and are both `0` at start     |
| `finish`     | A player finishes the round                              | At most once; `durationMs` is final and finish is not numbered |

| Additional field | Type       | Description                         | Rules                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `player`         | Player     | Full snapshot of the event's player | Required; matches `start.players[player.playerIndex]` |
| `checkpoint`     | Checkpoint | Checkpoint state for the event      | Required                                              |

#### Example

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
  "type": "checkpoint",
  "eventId": "a86f8d3d-7a36-4ec4-a9c9-60c69932bfd1",
  "sequence": 2,
  "occurredAt": "2026-06-21T12:35:06.789Z",

  },
  "source": {
    "pluginName": "Chugmania Webhooks",
    "pluginVersion": "1.0.0",
    "game": "turbo"
  },
  "player": {
    "playerIndex": 0,
    "name": "Player One"
  },
  "checkpoint": {
    "checkpointIndex": 1,
    "checkpointLapIndex": 1,
    "lapNumber": 1
  }
}
```

### `end`

Emitted when capture of the round ends. It adds `endReason` and contains no
player fields.

| Additional field | Type | Description                     | Rules                                             |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `endReason`      | enum | Reason the captured round ended | `completed`, `restarted`, `aborted`, or `unknown` |

In Trackmania Turbo, choosing **Give up** transitions the active player to the
game's eliminated state and is reported as `aborted`.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
